# Do-Bot-Done

This is a web application which can track your task (Todo just for now) made with react,firebase and node mongo,Especially for applying the CRUD operation
- You can add,update and delete a todo which will store in a database
- There is a functionality of create an account with the email verification and google login system, and password reset system
- I have used react ,tailwind to create front-end and node,js, espress and mongoDB as server and database
- I have used react-query/tanstack-query to fecth and refetch data from database
- Again use custom hooks for purpose
